# StartGame
A 2D rogue-like strategy game, where a player navigates through a randomised world and does missions. Fighting is turn based on randomly generated maps. Everything is written in C# and windows forms are used for GUI. All rendering is done using Bitmaps.

Due to change in account, the game will be continued in this fork.
# World Generation
Includes relativly complex world generation and models some real life systems.
